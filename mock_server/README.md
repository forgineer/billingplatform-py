# Mock Server

This directory contains a mock server designed to simulate the BillingPlatform API. The mock server runs as a standalone Flask application and serves basic responses to requests based on the publicly available BillingPlatform API documentation.

Where there are gaps in the official documentation, some responses are assumed and may be updated as more information becomes available.

**Usage:**  
Run this application in a standalone terminal session. It is intended for local development and testing purposes only.
